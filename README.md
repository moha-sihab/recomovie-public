# Recomovie (Recommendation Movie)

Recomovie is an Android Application to show information about movie and add to favorite list. I streamed API from themoviedb.org and then I stored in Room.
I developed Recomovie as final submission in Dicoding course "Menjadi Android Developer Expert" https://www.dicoding.com/academies/165
